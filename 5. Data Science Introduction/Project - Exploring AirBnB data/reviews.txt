There is no perfect solution here but you can explore other scalars and then compare them how they are different.

You should do imputation after scaling because scaling requires computing mean and variance, if imputation before scaling, 
then the true means and variances of the features would be corrupted by the filled missing values, 
so I think scaling on the non-missing data and then do imputation for the missing values would be more reasonable.
