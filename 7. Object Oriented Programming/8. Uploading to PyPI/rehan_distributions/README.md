## Project Motivation
This project was created as part of Udacity's Data Scientist for Enterprise nanodegree. This is just a sample project which calculates Gaussian and Binomial distributions.

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation

The code should run using any Python versions 3.*. I used python 3.6.

Libraries Used : matplotlib

If you don't have python already installed, I would suggest you to install the Anaconda distribution of Python, as you will get all the necessary libraries together.
